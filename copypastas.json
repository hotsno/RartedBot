But then, everything changed when the Virus nation attacked.\n\nOnly the Avaccine, master of all four elements, could stop it. But when the world needed him most, he wouldn't be developed for another year or so.\n\nWhat felt like a hundred years passed, and my brother and I, while socially distanced, discovered the new Avaccine: an Timepasser named \"Quarantaang,\" and though his prevention skills are great, he's still got a lot to learn before anybody takes him seriously.\n\nBut I believe Quarantaang can save the world.```",
    "bruh": "```A popular concept in the known world is the idea of the “bruh moment.” A “bruh moment” is defined as “bruh velocity” multiplied by “bruh mass.” In other words, the larger a “bruh velocity” or a “bruh mass” is, the overall larger a “bruh moment” will be. For example, something that hits harder has a larger “bruh mass,” such as karen taking the kids as opposed to spilling your drink. The faster something hits is known to have a larger “bruh velocity,” such as a fast moving train vs the slow inevitability of death as it crushes our very souls second by second and we’ll eventually succumb to the cold embrace of the Reaper himself. In these examples, we can clearly demonstrate exactly how much of a “bruh moment” something really is.```"
