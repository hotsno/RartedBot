    "normie": "```\nI did an epic troll on my normie class\n\nMy class is full of NORMIES! So I trolled them\n\nSo we had a substitute teacher and he went to get something from the back room. I decided to pin a picture of small Keanu Reeves along with big Chungus on the wall. Everyone starts saying “Sit down fucking idiot.” I say “No u” along with “destruction 100.” I’m on the floor dying right now while the class cannot understand the funny reference. Then I see some girl next to me on her phone. So I decide to lean and see what she’s doing. Turns out, she’s an INSTANormie and I yell “FUCKING NORMIE (with Pepe angry face) REEEEEE. USE REDDIT YOU FUCKING TUMOR!” Everyone is uncultured and looks at me like a weirdo. The girl says “The fuck is wrong with you? I don’t care about your stupid opinions.” I reply by making a Joe Joe reference “DIE NORMIE! (Here comes Joe Joe reference) MUDA MUDA MUDA!” My class starts yelling at me calling me autistic because they don’t know memes. The sub comes back and sees Keanu Chungus and this happens.\n\nSub: Who did this\n\nMe: Oh I think it was Joe\n\nSub: What?\n\nMe: JOE Mama\n\nI start Rolf (rolling on the floor laughing) and Xding (XD is an emoticon for laughing, better than cancer emojis FYI.) My sub gives the entire class lunch detention and everyone is mad at me but at least it was epic lol. Just wish people were more cultured in Reddit.\n\nI’d like to remind everyone that after school everyone was talking shit abt me. So I stood in front of them on the planter T posing going “mmmmmmmmmmm” and “DOOT DOOT.” Fucking everyone calls me a weirdo. I see a group of kids on their phones, so I walked and they were playing Fortnite like faggots (term by 4chan). So I call them a bunch of autists and how Minecraft is better. They walked away like a bunch fucking noons. People STARE at me when I tap them saying “CREEPER....” It’s a Minecraft parody that’s not that bad musically but they’re supposed to respond with “Aww man.” But nobody ever does.\n```",
    "yev": "```\nI saw exactly 1.09441 square inches of yev's feet today. I immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my übernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It vaporized yev as it punched right through her, barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder. The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of Illinois to fall pregnant with my children. When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble of my high school, I rest easy, knowing every one of my sons will repeat my glorious actions. Goodbye.\n```",
    "frick": "```\n\"Go fuck yourself\"\nWhat if I'm already fucking myself? Behind this simple insult hides a universal paradox that may put your sexuality in question. Let's do a simple thought experiment: imagine us two standing in front of each other. I, of course, am wearing a pair of jeans, that are covering my genitals and my butt. You then command me to \"go fuck myself\". I may be fucking myself already. I may as well not be fucking myself already. Until my dick and its position relative to my ass is observed, it is simultaneously in my ass, but also outside of it - thus, it stays in superposition. The moment you lay eyes on my penis, both states collide with each other and become either one. You may have already guessed what the problem here is. As soon as a single photon reflected by my dick enters either one of your eyes, you become gay. The only way to avoid this is to not observe my penis. But if you don't look at it, then you will never know if your insult had any effect, thus rendering it meaningless. Since you have already made the insult, you are now, too, in superposition - you're either wrong, or gay. It's unfortunate, really - you dug a hole for yourself without even knowing it. All you can do now is accept it, and learn from your mistakes.\n```",

I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭\n\nIn conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as \"R/Wooooosh\" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as \"Schadenfreude,\" which means \"harm-joy\" 😬😲.

But then, everything changed when the Virus nation attacked.\n\nOnly the Avaccine, master of all four elements, could stop it. But when the world needed him most, he wouldn't be developed for another year or so.\n\nWhat felt like a hundred years passed, and my brother and I, while socially distanced, discovered the new Avaccine: an Timepasser named \"Quarantaang,\" and though his prevention skills are great, he's still got a lot to learn before anybody takes him seriously.\n\nBut I believe Quarantaang can save the world.```",
    "bruh": "```A popular concept in the known world is the idea of the “bruh moment.” A “bruh moment” is defined as “bruh velocity” multiplied by “bruh mass.” In other words, the larger a “bruh velocity” or a “bruh mass” is, the overall larger a “bruh moment” will be. For example, something that hits harder has a larger “bruh mass,” such as karen taking the kids as opposed to spilling your drink. The faster something hits is known to have a larger “bruh velocity,” such as a fast moving train vs the slow inevitability of death as it crushes our very souls second by second and we’ll eventually succumb to the cold embrace of the Reaper himself. In these examples, we can clearly demonstrate exactly how much of a “bruh moment” something really is.```",
